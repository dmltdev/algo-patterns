Bubble Sort 

*Pseudocode:
bubbleSort(array)
  for i <- 1 to indexOfLastUnsortedElement-1
    if leftElement > rightElement
      swap leftElement and rightElement
end bubbleSort

*Time complexity: O(N^2)
— best: O(n); | If the array is already sorted, then there is no need for sorting.
— worst: O(n^2); | If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then the worst case occurs.
— average: O(n^2); | It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).

*Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable is used for swapping.

*Bubble sort is used if
— complexity does not matter
— short and simple code is preferred

!In the optimized bubble sort algorithm, two extra variables may be used: flag "swapped" (becomes true if elements are swapped) and var "temp" (to hold the temp value of arr[i]). Hence, the space complexity will be O(2).
!But we can use a destructuring assignment to get rid of the extra variable "temp".
