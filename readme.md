# Algorithms & Data Structures

## See my way of learning algorithms and data structures with Javascript/Typescript

Each algorithm and data structure is tested with Jest.
Performance is benchmarked with Benchmark.JS

### Three rules of determining Big O

* Algorithm grows as the size of the input grows
* Constants are dropped
* Worst case is usually the way we measure

### Algorithm Types

* Search Algorithms
* Sorting Algorithms
